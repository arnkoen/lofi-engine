## LOFI-ENGINE

Inspired by the wasm4 fantasy console I ravaged a wip game project and tried to make a minimal game lib which uses wasm modules to load the game.

This is not meant for anything serious. Its far from complete and most likely buggy as hell, but I think it could be fun.

For now I only tested it on windows.

More information soon.
